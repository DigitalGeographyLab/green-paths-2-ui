            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
              While fresh air, quietness and greenery bring health benefits, air
              pollution and excess noise may cause physical and mental health
              problems such as respiratory infections, cardiovascular disease,
              or stress. Fortunately, a more peaceful, less polluted, and
              greener (= healthier) route may be just slightly longer than the
              shortest one.
